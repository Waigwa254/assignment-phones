<h1>WAIGWAS PHONES AND REPAIR</h1>

<h2>What We Do</h2>
<p>Around 2005, 3G technology became more prominent, and cell phone technology continued
    to improve rapidly. Mobile internet became more important to users as
    social media and internet-based communications emerged. Phone
    processors were quickly
    becoming more advanced, and phones were more commonly popping up
    with features such as a video
    camera, GPS, and music
    capabilities.</p>

<H3>Services we offer</H3>
<p>So much so that most of us get habituate of smartphones and need our devices to always function
    smoothly. However, mobiles are eventually machines, susceptible to bugs, crashes, and other damages
    over time. And whenever they develop any issue, we can’t help being panic imagining they will have
    to be given away for cell
    phone repair.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>If restarting doesn’t work, use your phone in a safe mode for a while. See if the \]
    buttons are working fine in safe mode. If yes, then you need to delete the recently d
    ownloaded apps, or better, try the factory reset on t
    he device.</p>
